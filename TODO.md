# Primary list of project tasks organized by date in descending order.

- [ ] Determine why the program hangs; killed by 10 sec timeout. AS MP
- [ ] Review the existing argument parsing and determine whether it works for user programs having multiple arguments.  Indicate problems and propose solutions for this.  ZA
- [ ] Pass the args-none test (created by typing *make tests/userprog/args-none.result* in userprog/build. TT
- [ ] Determine how best to access user memory (manual p. 27).  Validating user addresses. HA
- [ ] Implement exit syscall.  What happens when a program ends? SK
- [ ] Syscall write needs to work. KK
