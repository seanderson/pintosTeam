# pintosTeam

This is where we work together to complete as much as possible of
Lab 5 in CMSC 326 at Bard.


## Guidelines

We will use part of every class meeting as a scrum session in which we discuss progress and plan work for the next two days.  It's important that you make it to class for these meetings and participate.

* When working on a new piece (e.g., a new system call or testing procedure) create a new branch.  We should keep the main branch as clean as possible.  It should always be our most correct version.
* When getting ready to work on a branch, switch to it and pull.  The first two letters of the branch should be your upper case initials. This will ensure you start on the most recent version of the code and save us time later.
* Notify us, your team, when you have merged back to main---always!
* When you commit, your message should clearly explain what changes were made and what new test were passed (or failed!).
* Ask another team member to review your code **before** you merge a pull request.
* Please put your initials at the beginning of every comment that precedes your changes in the code. (e.g., my changes are preceded by // SEA).
